- **Accessibility features**: ARIA roles, labels, and landmarks that improve the experience for screen reader users.
- **Form elements**: The quiz contains form elements with labels, making it accessible for various assistive technologies. 
- **Navigation**: A clear navigation menu is provided with links to different sections of the quiz.
